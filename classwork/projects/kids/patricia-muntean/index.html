    <h2 style="color:#00BBDD;background-color:lightgreen;text-align:center;">How can we stop racism?</h2>
    <p style="background-color:bisque; text-align:center;">Well, we can't stop racism, because it's everywhere. Instead we can help to reduce it. For the first step we need to
        learn how to accept all the people, doesn't matter if they are black, catolic or yellow. We need to accept that if
        they are different, they are still humans just like us.</p>
    <p style="background-color:bisque;text-align:center;">For the second step we need to learn how to defend the victims of racism. The victims have no guilt, they didn't choose
        to be born different, just like us, we didn't choose to be born blackor white and that's why they should be equal
        to us.</p>
    <h3 style="color:azure; background-color:#22CCDD;text-align:center;">We don't have to use violence</h3>
    <p style="background-color:bisque; text-align:center;">The last time when we used violence we created a war. Everyone know what i'm talking about. And if you don't know, let
        me remind you about Hitler and the nazis. This man created a world full of chaos and cruel deaths, because he was
        racist and used violence against jewish. But why? For what? For showing us his power? No, I'll tell you for what.
        For nothing.</p>
    <div class="adoua-imagine"></div>
    <h4 style="color:red; background-color:aquamarine;text-align:center;">We need this change</h4>
    <p style="background-color:bisque;text-align:center;">Why we need this? We need this because if we are unite, we are stronger. We will create a new world, a better one.</p>
    <div class="atreia-imagine"></div>
    <p style="background-color:bisque; text-align:center;"> We are all humans and we need to be equal even if we don't have the same religion or the same skin color. If we were
        all the same, the world wouldn't be so misterious. All the differences between the countrys or the places makes our
        life so full of new experiences and beautiful.</p>
    <h2 style="color:burlywood; background-color:indianred;text-align:center;">Let's talk about the beauty of differences</h2>
    <p style="background-color:bisque;text-align:center;">I would like to tell you more about the cultures, about the differences between them. Because of the different cultures
        we have all the misterious legends and traditions, like Christmas tradition or Easter tradition. We all love Christmas
        and all over the world are different traditions or different names for Santa Claus. The black people, they are very
        different, but almost all of them have a beautiful voice, they are basicaly better than us, the white people. And
        this fact was defined by Bolt, the runner. The chinese people, the "yellow" one, they are good at selling and producing
        things. I mean, if you enter into a store, a clothes store, half or more of the products are made in China. We couldn't
        never be equal at everything, like running, singing or producing stuff, but we can be equal in society.</p>
    <h3 style="color:darkgoldenrod; background-color:#00FFAA;text-align:center;"> Now let's talk about the people who fought against racism</h3>
    <p style="background-color:bisque;text-align:center;">First of them was Abraham Lincoln(1809-1865). He made the famous Emancipation Proclamation (1863) declaring “that all
        persons held as slaves” within the rebellious states “are, and henceforward shall be free". The second one was a
        sclave who escape and returned to lead the others slave to freedom on the Undergroung Railroad, Hariet Tubman(1822-1913).
        She became a well-known speaker on the experiences of slavery and an advocate for the rights of African Americans
        and black women. Another one is Martin Luther King(1929-1968). He helped to organise the 1963 March on Washington,
        where he gave his famous speech "I have a dream": "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
        out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.". And
        another one, the last for now, is Dietrich Bunhoeffer(1906-1945). Principled Christian activist who opposed the Nazi
        regime in Germany. He opposed Hitler’s euthanasia program and persecution of the Jews.</p>
