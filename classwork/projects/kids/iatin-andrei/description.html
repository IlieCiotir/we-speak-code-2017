	<div class="text2">The Nissan GT-R is a 2-door 2+2 high performance vehicle produced by Nissan unveiled in 2007. It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, the name having been given over to the V35 Series and having since left its racing roots. The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, launching in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.</div>
