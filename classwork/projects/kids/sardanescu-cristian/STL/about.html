	<div class="second" class="text"><p><b>Jean-Philip Grobler, known for his musical project St. Lucia, is a South African singer and musician based in Brooklyn. He is signed to Columbia Records and to date has released two albums: When the Night (2013) and Matter (2016).</b></p></div>
	<div class="second" class="text"><p>Grobler was born in Johannesburg and raised in South Africa. He spent much of his childhood singing in the Drakensberg Boys' Choir which travelled and performed internationally. Grobler started making music when he was 12 years old. He was inspired by Boyz II Men, Michael Jackson, Sting and Phil Collins. He soon was experimenting with rock music. However, after 10 years, he got bored with it and got back to the 80s music influences from his childhood. In 2013, when asked about his main musical influences, he noted Phil Collins, Fleetwood Mac (especially Tango in the Night), Radiohead (OK Computer), Mew (And the Glass Handed Kites), and Paul Simon (Graceland). He has also cited Lionel Richie's album Dancing on the Ceiling as an influence.</p></div>
	<div class="second" class="text"><p>At the age of 19 Grobler left South Africa to study music in Liverpool, UK. After studying music at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in England for three years he moved to Brooklyn, NY. There he worked for The Lodge, which helps with music licensing for films and television shows, while continuing to work on his own music. When he was signed to Neon Gold Records in 2012, they re-released his self-titled EP he had previously released independently. Also, during the time, he featured vocals in The Knocks' single "Modern Hearts", which was released in 2013. His debut full-length album, When the Night, was released in October 2013. Live performances have included fellow musicians Nick Brown, Ross Clark, Dustin Kaufman, Nicky Paul and Patricia Beranek. Grobler has also remixed tracks for such bands as Passion Pit, Foster the People, The colourist and Charli XCX. He produced the debut album by HAERTS. Grobler also opened for Two Door Cinema Club during their 2013 tours. Grobler kicked off his St. Lucia 2014 nationwide tour in Philadelphia on January 13, 2014, and continued to tour across the U.S. and Australia in the months following.</p></div>
	<div class="second" class="text"><p>St. Lucia released the track "Dancing On Glass" in October 2015, and its music video in November 2015. The next single, "Physical", was released in December 2015. These two singles appear on the second studio album, Matter, released on January 29, 2016. A music video was then released for "Help Me Run Away," another song on the album, Matter, in June 2016. The album cover was designed by Jean-Philip Grobler and Patti Beranek from St. Lucia, along with Silas Adler from Soulland, the Danish men's fashion brand.</p></div>
